# README #

This is the README of the first GIT Package of the famous Orgelbank Project

### FPDF
The "Wartungsbogen" is using custom fonts. In order to use them, you have to make the directory writeable.
Then delete the pre-configured PHP files, like
* dejavusanscondensed.mtx.php
* dejavusanscondensed-bold.mtx.php
* dejavusanscondensed-bold.cw127.php
* dejavusanscondensed.cw127.php
* dejavusanscondensed.cw127.dat
* dejavusanscondensed-bold.cw.dat

Then manually execute the script in the browser to re-generate the files. Maybe two executions are required...:
